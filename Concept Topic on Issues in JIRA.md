Introduction
In Jira, issues refer to the actions a team has to perform in a project. Issues help in tracking the work progress, starting from creation to completion. It can represent a software bug, a project activity, a support complaint, a feature, a sub-task, or a task that needs completion and tracking. 
Issues are the foundation of any Jira project as they help teams to manage their workload while tracking the progress. Issues are identified and categorized into different issue types based on your organizationâ€™s projects. 
Common issue types in JIRA include:
Bug: An error or a defect in the software that needs to be fixed.
Task: A generic task or work that needs to be completed.
Story: A single feature that is to be implemented.
